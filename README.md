# Docker Cleanup Script for Linux users

## With a simple execution it solves the common problem of cluttered containers
### Without docker desktop just execute 
``bash docker_cleanup.sh``

Preventing potential conflicts or issues down the line.

This script clears out any lingering containers from your Docker environment and gives Docker a fresh start. It's like a reset button for your development environment,ensuring a clean slate before you start working. 

As a Linux user facing Docker environment issues, this script comes to the rescue. 

### Personally I use it every day at least once before I start working. Hope it will work for you!
